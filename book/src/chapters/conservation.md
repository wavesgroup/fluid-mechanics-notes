In this chapter we will derive the fundamental equations for fluid flows:
continuity, momentum, and energy.
We start with the conservation of mass, which is the easiest to derive, but also
arguably the most fundamental.

## Conservation of mass

Recall from the previous chapter that we can take at least two perspectives
on the fluid flow: the Lagrangian perspective, which follows a fluid parcel as it
moves through space, and the Eulerian perspective, which observes the flow at
fixed points in space.
We can thus derive the conservation of mass, or commonly known as the
<em>continuity</em>, from both perspectives.
Let's start with the Eulerian perspective, as it may seem more intuitive to
derive from first principles.

### Eulerian derivation

Consider a fixed rectangular volume $\Delta V = \Delta x \Delta y \Delta z$ in
three-dimensional space.
The mass of the fluid in this volume is $\rho \Delta V$, where $\rho$ is the
density of the fluid.
The fluid enters the volume through the surfaces of the box, and the rate at
which the mass enters the volume through a surface is given by the product of
the density, the velocity component normal to the surface, and the area of the
surface.
Let's call this velocity $\mathbf{u}$ with components $u$, $v$, and $w$ in the
$x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively.

For simplicity, let's first consider only the $x$-component of the velocity.
This scenario is illustrated in Fig. <a class="ref" data-key="fig:continuity1"></a>.
The fluid mass flow rate into the volume through the left face is $\rho u \Delta y \Delta z$,
and the mass flow rate out of the volume through the right face is
$\rho (u + \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \Delta x) \Delta y \Delta z$.
The net mass increase in the control volume must be governed by the net mass
inflow excess relative to the net mass outflow:

  <figcaption>

Mass conservation in an rectangular Eulerian control volume. The mass convergence, $\partial(\rho u)/\partial x$ (plus contributions in the $y$ and $z$ directions), must be balanced by a density decrease. This is Fig. 1.1 in AOFD (Vallis, 2017).

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="display-math">

$$
\int_V \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} dV =
\rho u \Delta y \Delta z - \left(\rho u + \frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x} \Delta x\right) \Delta y \Delta z
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math">

$$
\int_V \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} dV =
- \frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x} \Delta x \Delta y \Delta z
$$

</div>

Now, if we allow the flow field to have components in the $y$ and $z$ directions
as well, the equation becomes:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\int_V \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} dV =
- \left[\frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial (\rho v)}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial (\rho w)}{\partial z} \right] \Delta V
$$

</div>

Let $\Delta V \to 0$ to such that any field within $\Delta V$ is uniform to obtain:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:continuity_eulerian">

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0
$$

</div>

This is the continuity equation in the Eulerian reference frame.

Drag the mass-flux arrows on each face of the control volume below.
The local density tendency is minus the sum of the three divergence
contributions.

<div class="interactive-slot" data-interactive="continuity-volume"></div>

We're not constrained to a rectangular, fixed volume, however.
We can derive this equation for an arbitrary control volume using the divergence
theorem.
The total rate of change of that volume as it moves with the fluid is equal to
the surface integral of the velocity field $\mathbf{u}$ through the surface
$S$ that is bounding the volume $V$ (Fig. <a class="ref" data-key="fig:continuity2"></a>).
Mathematically, we can express this as:

<figure class="book-figure" id="fig:continuity2">
  <img src="/figures/fig_continuity2.svg" alt="Mass conservation in an arbitrary Eulerian control volume bounded by a surface . The mass increase, is equal to the mass" />
  <figcaption>

Mass conservation in an arbitrary Eulerian control volume $V$ bounded by a surface $S$. The mass increase, $\int_V(\partial \rho/\partial t)dV$ is equal to the mass flowing into the volume, $-\int_S(\rho\mathbf{v}) \cdot d\mathbf{S} = -\int_V \nabla \cdot (\rho\mathbf{v})dV$. This is Fig. 1.2 in AOFD (Vallis, 2017).

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="display-math">

$$
\int_V \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} dV = - \int_S \rho \mathbf{u} \cdot d\mathbf{S}
$$

</div>

Now, recall the divergence theorem (Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:divergence_theorem"></a>) to obtain:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\int_V \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} dV = - \int_V \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) dV
$$

</div>

Let $\Delta V \to 0$ to integrate and drop $\Delta V$ on both sides to obtain
Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:continuity_eulerian"></a>, which is the Eulerian form of the continuity
equation.

### Lagrangian derivation

In the Lagrangian frame, we follow a fluid parcel as it moves through space.
Its mass $\rho \Delta V$ is constant by definition, but its density or volume
may change.
Since the mass of the parcel is constant, its Lagrangian derivative is zero:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\frac{d}{dt} (\rho \Delta V) = 0
$$

</div>

Since the mass doesn't change, any change in the density of the parcel must be
balanced by a change in its volume:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\Delta V \frac{d\rho}{dt} + \rho \frac{d\Delta V}{dt} = 0
$$

</div>

Recall that we've already derived the Lagrangian derivative of a volume of the
fluid parcel (Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:lagrangian_volume_derivative"></a>), which is the second
term here.
The equation becomes:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\Delta V \frac{d\rho}{dt} + \Delta V \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
$$

</div>

Finally, drop $\Delta V$ on both sides to obtain the Lagrangian form of the
continuity equation:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:continuity_lagrangian">

$$
\frac{d\rho}{dt} + \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
$$

</div>

Equations <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:continuity_eulerian"></a> and <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:continuity_lagrangian"></a> are
two fundamental expressions of the conservation of mass for a fluid.
In one form or another, this equation is a critical component of all weather,
ocean, and climate prediction models.

### Continuity of an incompressible fluid

Liquids are nearly incompressible, and for them $\frac{d\rho}{dt} = 0$ is a good
approximation.
For an incompressible fluid, the continuity equation simplifies to:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:continuity_incompressible">

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
$$

</div>

Although as simple as it gets, Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:continuity_incompressible"></a> is
extremely important in fluid dynamics.

## Conservation of momentum

Like the conservation of mass, the conservation of momentum is a fundamental
concept in fluid mechanics.
It allows us to predict how the fluid should accelerate due to its state
(i.e. velocity and density) and due to the forces acting on it.
Together, the continuity and momentum conservation
equations form the core of most fluid prediction models, such as weather, ocean,
and climate prediction models.
We will derive the momentum equation in the remainder of this section.
We'll start from the most basic form first and then incrementally introduce
some common forces, such as the pressure gradient force, gravity, and viscosity.

### The first step

To derive the momentum conservation equation, we will start from the second
Newton's law, which states that the time rate of change of the momentum of a
fluid particle is equal to the net force acting on it.
For a fluid parcel of volume $\Delta V = \int_V dV$ whose momentum per unit mass
is $\rho \mathbf{u}$, the momentum conservation equation is:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \int_V \rho \mathbf{u} dV = \int_V \mathbf{F} dV
$$

</div>

where $\mathbf{F}$ is the net force per unit volume acting on the fluid parcel.
Let again the volume parcel be very small such that its density and net force
acting on it are uniform. We have:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\rho \frac{d\mathbf{u}}{dt} \Delta V = \mathbf{F} \Delta V
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math">

$$
\rho \frac{d\mathbf{u}}{dt} = \mathbf{F}
$$

</div>

Recall the Lagrangian derivative operator from Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:lagrangian_derivative"></a>
to obtain:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:momentum_eulerian">

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{\rho}
$$

</div>

This equation states that the acceleration of a fluid parcel at any fixed point
in space is equal to the net force per unit mass acting on it, divided by the
fluid density.
The second term on the left-hand side is the <em>advection term</em>.
It represents the local acceleration of the fluid parcel due to the properties
of the fluid flow itself.
Consider for example a 1-dimensional flow such that the advection term reduces
to $u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$.
Notice that the advection term is zero only in two special cases:
when the velocity is zero or when the velocity is spatially uniform.
In all other cases the advection term is non-zero and contributes to the local
acceleration.

Because the advection term is velocity multiplied by its gradient, it is
<em>nonlinear</em>.
This single property of this term makes accurate analysis and prediction of
fluid flows difficult.
For example, the nonlinear advection term is responsible for the existence of
<em>chaos</em> in fluid flows, where small differences in initial
conditions lead to vastly different outcomes (in popular culture known as the
<em>butterfly effect</em>).
One consequence of this in our daily lives is that weather predictability
is limited to a finite lead time horizon, for example one to two weeks depending
on the weather patterns of interest.
If, however, we could assume that either the velocity or its gradient are so
small that they could be neglected, the equation simplifies significantly
and often allows for analytical solutions.
$\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}$ is the most important term for
turbulence, weather prediction and predictability, and a major obstacle toward
analytical solutions of Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:momentum_eulerian"></a> and its variants.
Remember this now.

Back to our equation.
For a 3-dimensional Cartesian flow where the velocity field is $\mathbf{u} = (u, v, w)$
and net forces are $\mathbf{F} = (F_x, F_y, F_z)$, Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:momentum_eulerian"></a>
becomes a system of three equations, one for each component of the velocity field.
Recall from the Lagrangian derivative operator that $\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}$
is an operator acting on $\mathbf{u}$ (as opposed to divergence of a gradient).
The $\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla$ operator then expands to
$u\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$.
Our vector equations becomes a system of three scalar equations:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + w \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} = \frac{F_x}{\rho}
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math">

$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + w \frac{\partial v}{\partial z} = \frac{F_y}{\rho}
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math">

$$
\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} + w \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} = \frac{F_z}{\rho}
$$

</div>

Each of the prognostic equations for the velocity components thus has exactly
three advective components that correspond to the gradients of the velocity
in each respective direction.

### Incorporating the forces

Now we should consider what forces may be acting on the fluid.
We distinguish between two types of forces: surface forces and body forces.
Surface forces act on the surface of the fluid parcel due to the motion of the
fluid molecules, in all directions at that surface.
For example, organized motion of molecules into the surface may cause pressure
on that surface, and the sheared motion of molecules (e.g. if flow is
antiparallel to the surface) may cause shear stress on the surface, leading to
the deformation of the fluid parcel.
In contrast, body forces act remotely (meaning, from a distance) on the entire
volume of the fluid parcel because that parcel is immersed in one or more force fields.
Gravity is one such body force, and it's the only one we'll consider here.
Although in Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:momentum_eulerian"></a> we wrote the net force as $\mathbf{F}$,
it's useful to write it as the sum of body forces $\mathbf{F}_b$ and surface
forces $\mathbf{F}_s$:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{\rho} (\mathbf{F}_s + \mathbf{F}_b)
$$

</div>

Let's derive the surface forces first.
We want to find out the local change of momentum only due to the surface forces.
Analogous to how the flow through the volume determined the rate of change of
density inside that volume, as we saw in the continuity equation
(Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:continuity_eulerian"></a>), the change in momentum inside the volume
is determined by the surface forces acting on the volume (Fig. <a class="ref" data-key="fig:momentum1"></a>).

<figure class="book-figure" id="fig:momentum1">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Mathematically, we can express this change as:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\int_V \mathbf{F_s} dV = \int_S \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot d\mathbf{S}
$$

</div>

where $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is the second-order stress tensor acting on the
surface $S$ of the fluid parcel.
As before, recall the divergence theorem (Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:divergence_theorem"></a>) to obtain:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\int_V \mathbf{F_s} dV = \int_V \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} dV
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math">

$$
\mathbf{F_s} = \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}
$$

</div>

The surface force thus equals the divergence of the stress tensor.
Insert this into Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:momentum_eulerian"></a> to get our new form of
the momentum equation:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:momentum_cauchy">

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} =
\frac{1}{\rho} \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \frac{\mathbf{F}_b}{\rho}
$$

</div>

This form of the momentum equation is often called the
<em>Cauchy momentum equation</em>.

Let's now look at what this stress tensor divergence term
$\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is.

### Pressure gradient

There is a fundamental difference in the meaning of the diagonal and off-diagonal
components of the stress tensor.
The diagonal components of the stress tensor, $\sigma_{xx}$, $\sigma_{yy}$, and
$\sigma_{zz}$, represent the normal stress components, i.e. the force per unit
area acting on a surface element that is oriented in the $x$, $y$, and $z$
directions, respectively.
The off-diagonal components of the stress tensor represent the shear stress
components, each acting on all three surfaces.
For example, $\sigma_{xy}$ represents the $x$-component of the stress tensor
acting on the surface that is perpendicular to the $y$-axis.
Let's write out the stress tensor in Cartesian coordinates:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{xx} & \sigma_{xy} & \sigma_{xz} \\
\sigma_{yx} & \sigma_{yy} & \sigma_{yz} \\
\sigma_{zx} & \sigma_{zy} & \sigma_{zz}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

</div>

This tensor can be decomposed into an isotropic pressure contribution and a
viscous contribution:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:stress_tensor_decomposition">

$$
\boldsymbol{\sigma} = -p \mathbf{I} + \boldsymbol{\tau}
$$

</div>

where $p$ is the pressure, $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor,
and $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ is the viscous stress tensor, which can contain both
normal and shear stresses.
For the incompressible Newtonian flow considered below, $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ is
also deviatoric, meaning that its trace is zero.
Written out explicitly in Cartesian coordinates and using Eq.
<a class="eqref" data-key="eq:stress_tensor_decomposition"></a>, the stress tensor is:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \begin{bmatrix}
-p + \tau_{xx} & \tau_{xy} & \tau_{xz} \\
\tau_{yx} & -p + \tau_{yy} & \tau_{yz} \\
\tau_{zx} & \tau_{zy} & -p + \tau_{zz}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

</div>

The divergence of the stress tensor is then:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = - \nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau}
$$

</div>

Let's insert this into Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:momentum_eulerian"></a> to get our new form of
the momentum equation:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:momentum_cauchy_with_shear">

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} =
- \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau} + \frac{\mathbf{F}_b}{\rho}
$$

</div>

Pressure is one of the fluid properties that determine its state.
Collective, organized, motion of molecules at a macroscopic scale induces
pressure on a surface and an associated force acting normal to that surface.
Recall that the surface vector is normal to the surface and pointing outward,
and the force acting on the fluid surface is oriented inward, thus the minus sign.

In an ideal, <em>inviscid</em> fluid, that is, a fluid that exhibits no viscous
forces, the stress tensor $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is only composed of the diagonal
terms (pressure). The viscous stress is zero, but the total stress divergence
is $-\nabla p$, which need not vanish.
Dropping $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau}$ and the body forces $\mathbf{F}_b$ for
now, the Cauchy momentum equation simplifies to:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:momentum_euler">

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} =
- \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p
$$

</div>

This form of the momentum equation is often called the <em>Euler equation</em>.

<span id="sec:viscous_forces" class="sec-anchor"></span>

### Viscous forces

Now, let's look at the viscous stress tensor divergence $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau}$.
Written out explicitly as a matrix of all its components, $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ is:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\boldsymbol{\tau} = \begin{bmatrix}
\tau_{xx} & \tau_{xy} & \tau_{xz} \\
\tau_{yx} & \tau_{yy} & \tau_{yz} \\
\tau_{zx} & \tau_{zy} & \tau_{zz}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

</div>

The diagonal components of the viscous stress tensor are the viscous normal stresses,
while the off-diagonal components are the shear stresses.
Viscous normal stresses can be non-zero even in incompressible flow: a fluid
parcel can stretch in one direction while contracting in another without
changing its volume.
In an inviscid fluid, all components of $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ vanish.
For an ordinary fluid without couple stresses, angular momentum conservation
requires the stress tensor to be symmetric, so $\tau_{xy} = \tau_{yx}$,
$\tau_{xz} = \tau_{zx}$, and $\tau_{yz} = \tau_{zy}$.
For example, $\tau_{xy}$ is the force in the $x$ direction per unit area on a
face normal to the $y$ direction. The stress divergence is the vector:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau} = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial \tau_{xx}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \tau_{xy}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \tau_{xz}}{\partial z} \\
\frac{\partial \tau_{yx}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \tau_{yy}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \tau_{yz}}{\partial z} \\
\frac{\partial \tau_{zx}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \tau_{zy}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \tau_{zz}}{\partial z}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

</div>

Now, write out <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:momentum_cauchy_with_shear"></a> as a system of three scalar
equations, one for each component of the velocity field, and insert the shear
stress divergence terms to get:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} +
u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} +
v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} +
w \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} =
- \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} +
\frac{1}{\rho} \left( \frac{\partial \tau_{xx}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \tau_{xy}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \tau_{xz}}{\partial z} \right) +
\frac{F_x}{\rho}
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math">

$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} +
u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} +
v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} +
w \frac{\partial v}{\partial z} =
- \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} +
\frac{1}{\rho} \left( \frac{\partial \tau_{yx}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \tau_{yy}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \tau_{yz}}{\partial z} \right) +
\frac{F_y}{\rho}
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math">

$$
\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} +
u \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} +
v \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} +
w \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} =
- \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} +
\frac{1}{\rho} \left( \frac{\partial \tau_{zx}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \tau_{zy}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \tau_{zz}}{\partial z} \right) +
\frac{F_z}{\rho}
$$

</div>

Each of the prognostic equations for the velocity components thus has exactly
one pressure gradient, one viscous normal stress gradient, and two shear stress
gradient terms, all arising from the surface forces.

To express the viscous stress in terms of velocity, we need a
<em>constitutive relation</em>: a model of how the material responds to deformation.
Conservation laws alone do not determine this relation.
Adding a uniform velocity to the whole fluid does not change its deformation
or viscous stress, so the relevant quantity is the relative motion of nearby
fluid particles.
For particles separated by a small vector $\delta\mathbf{x}$, their velocity
difference is, to first order,
$\delta\mathbf{u} \approx (\nabla\mathbf{u})\delta\mathbf{x}$.
With velocity components $u$, $v$, and $w$ in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions,
the velocity gradient is the tensor:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\nabla\mathbf{u} = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} \\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial z} \\
\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial w}{\partial z}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

</div>

The velocity gradient contains both deformation and rigid rotation.
Its symmetric part is the <em>rate-of-strain tensor</em>:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:rate_of_strain_tensor">

$$
\mathbf{D} = \frac{1}{2}\left[\nabla\mathbf{u} + (\nabla\mathbf{u})^T\right]
$$

</div>

Here the superscript $T$ denotes the transpose, which swaps rows and columns.
For example, $D_{xx}=\partial u/\partial x$ and
$D_{xy}=D_{yx}=\frac{1}{2}(\partial u/\partial y+\partial v/\partial x)$.
The antisymmetric part, $\frac{1}{2}[\nabla\mathbf{u}-(\nabla\mathbf{u})^T]$,
describes local rigid rotation, which does not deform the parcel.
For example, rigid rotation $\mathbf{u}=(-\Omega y,\Omega x,0)$, with constant
angular velocity $\Omega$, has a non-zero velocity gradient but $\mathbf{D}=0$.
It therefore produces no Newtonian viscous stress.

For a <em>Newtonian fluid</em>, the constitutive assumption is that viscous
stress depends linearly on the instantaneous local rate of strain.
For an isotropic fluid, whose material properties have no preferred direction,
the general linear relation is
$\boldsymbol{\tau}=2\mu\mathbf{D}+\lambda(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})\mathbf{I}$,
where $\mu$ and $\lambda$ are viscosity coefficients and $p$ is the thermodynamic
pressure. In compressible flow, this viscous stress need not be traceless.
From here on, we assume incompressible flow, so $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}=0$ and
the relation reduces to:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:newtonian_viscous_stress">

$$
\boldsymbol{\tau} = 2\mu\mathbf{D}
= \mu\left[\nabla\mathbf{u} + (\nabla\mathbf{u})^T\right]
$$

</div>

The coefficient $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. It depends on the material and
its thermodynamic state, including temperature, but for a Newtonian fluid it
does not depend on the rate of strain.
Experiments establish when this linear model is appropriate and measure $\mu$.
For simple shear, $\mathbf{u}=(u(y),0,0)$, this tensor relation gives the familiar
scalar law $\tau_{xy}=\tau_{yx}=\mu\,du/dy$.
It also gives viscous normal stresses such as $\tau_{xx}=2\mu\,\partial u/\partial x$.
For example, $\mathbf{u}=(ax,-ay,0)$, with constant $a$, is incompressible but has
$\tau_{xx}=2\mu a$ and $\tau_{yy}=-2\mu a$.

Inserting the incompressible constitutive relation into
Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:momentum_cauchy_with_shear"></a>, we get:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:cauchy_with_viscosity">

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} =
- \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla \cdot \left\{\mu\left[\nabla\mathbf{u} + (\nabla\mathbf{u})^T\right]\right\} +
\frac{\mathbf{F}_b}{\rho}
$$

</div>

If we also assume that the dynamic viscosity is spatially constant, the viscous
stress divergence simplifies as follows:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\tau}
= \mu\nabla^2\mathbf{u} + \mu\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})
= \mu\nabla^2\mathbf{u}
$$

</div>

The last equality uses incompressibility. The viscous force is retained;
only the term involving $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}$ vanishes.
This gives the incompressible <em>Navier-Stokes equation</em>:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:momentum_navier_stokes">

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} =
- \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} +
\frac{\mathbf{F}_b}{\rho}
$$

</div>

where $\nu = \frac{\mu}{\rho}$ is the kinematic viscosity.
The operator $\nabla^2 = \left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} \right)$
is the <em>Laplacian</em>.
It is a second-order differential operator that appears in many partial
differential equations, including the heat equation, the wave equation, and
the Laplace equation.
More on these later.

Let's now look at the body forces to conclude our derivation.

### Gravity

As we mentioned earlier, gravity is the only body force we'll consider here.
The force of gravity per unit mass is given by $\mathbf{g} = (0, 0, -g)$,
where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration.
Here we assume that the gravitational acceleration is constant and points downward.
Insert this into Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:momentum_navier_stokes"></a>, and assuming
incompressibility, we get:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} =
- \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \mathbf{g} + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}
$$

</div>

Written out explicitly for each of the three spatial dimensions ($x$, $y$, and $z$),
we get:

<div class="display-math">

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} +
u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} +
v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} +
w \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} =
- \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \nu \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} \right)
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math">

$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} +
u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} +
v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} +
w \frac{\partial v}{\partial z} =
- \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + \nu \left( \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial z^2} \right)
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math" id="eq:momentum_navier_stokes_scalar_w">

$$
\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} +
u \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} +
v \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} +
w \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} =
- \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} - g + \nu \left( \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial z^2} \right)
$$

</div>

This completes the full system of momentum conservation equations in the
Cartesian coordinate system.

## Hydrostatic balance

Take Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:momentum_navier_stokes_scalar_w"></a> and assume that the vertical
acceleration $\frac{dw}{dt}$ is small compared to $g$, and that the spatial
variations of $w$ are small.
We can then drop the $\frac{dw}{dt}$ and $\nu \nabla^2 w$ terms to get the
<em>hydrostatic approximation</em>:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:hydrostatic_approximation">

$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} = - \rho g
$$

</div>

which states that the vertical pressure gradient is governed by the density
of the fluid and the gravitational acceleration.
It's often a good approximation for large-scale atmospheric and oceanic flows,
where the vertical variations of the horizontal velocity components are much
smaller than the horizontal variations of the vertical velocity component.
Notice however that the hydrostatic approximation does not imply that there
is no vertical motion or that it does not vary over time.
Instead, according to the continuity equation (Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:continuity_lagrangian"></a>),
it means that the vertical motion is completely governed by the change in
density and the divergence of the horizontal velocity field.
Further, if the flow is incompressible ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$),
we get:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:hydrostatic_continuity">

$$
\frac{\partial w}{\partial z} = - \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}
$$

</div>

which relates the vertical acceleration to the horizontal divergence.
Integrating this equation vertically allows us to calculate the vertical velocity
anywhere in the fluid column provided bottom and top boundary conditions:

<div class="display-math">

$$
w\left(z\right) = w\left(z+\Delta z\right) - \int_z^{z+\Delta z} \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \right) dz'
$$

</div>

This relationship will prove to be extremely useful in ocean applications where
only the horizontal velocity field is resolved.
For example, a group of ocean surface drifters converging towards a region is
indicative of downwelling (downward motion in the ocean) in that region.
Another example is that of ocean circulation models, which are typically
designed as hydrostatic.
In the case of such models, the horizontal components of the velocity are
prognostic variables, and the vertical velocity is diagnosed using
Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:hydrostatic_continuity"></a>.

## Equation of state

Now that we have derived the mass and momentum conservation equations, let's
write them out together in vector form:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:momentum_navier_stokes_state">

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} =
- \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \mathbf{g} + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math" id="eq:continuity_eulerian_state">

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0
$$

</div>

Momentum and mass conservation equations are prognostic equations for the
vector velocity field $\mathbf{u}$ and the scalar density field $\rho$,
respectively.
Notice the one remaining unknown: the scalar pressure field $p$.
As of now, we have a system of two independent equations for the three unknowns:
$\mathbf{u}$, $p$, and $\rho$.
We need one more equation to close the system—the
<em>equation of state</em>—to relate the pressure to
the other properties of the fluid, such as temperature, density, and
composition.

The prognostic equations that we have derived so far describe equally well
the evolution of both the atmosphere and the ocean, despite their significant
differences.
The equation of state is where our systems of governing equations for the ocean
and the atmosphere begin to diverge.
Namely, the atmosphere is a mixture of dry air and water vapor, and the
ocean is composed of liquid water with varying amounts of dissolved salts.
These differences will reflect in the choice of the equation of state to use
in each of these systems.

### In the atmosphere

In the atmospheres, <em>ideal gas law</em>
is often used as the equation of state:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:ideal_gas_law">

$$
p = \rho R T
$$

</div>

where $R$ is the specific gas constant for the gas in question, and $T$ is the
temperature.
For the moist air, we need to account for both the properties of dry air
($R_d \approx\ 287\ J kg^{-1} K^{-1}$) and those of water vapor
($R_v \approx\ 461\ J kg^{-1} K^{-1}$).
The equation of state for moist air relies on the so-called
<em>virtual temperature</em> to account for the
moisture in the air:

<div class="display-math">

$$
p = \rho R_d T_v
$$

</div>

where:

<div class="display-math">

$$
T_v = T \left[1 + q \left(\frac{R_v}{R_d} - 1 \right) \right]
$$

</div>

where $q$ is the specific humidity of the air.
So, the equation of state for moist air is:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:equation_of_state_atmosphere">

$$
p = \rho R_d T \left[1 + q \left(\frac{R_v}{R_d} - 1 \right) \right]
$$

</div>

Recall that we intended to close our system of equations by finding the
equation for pressure.
Although we did solve for pressure, it seems that we introduced two new
unknown variables: the temperature $T$ and the specific humidity $q$.
Each of these variables are governed by their own conservation equations,
akin to that for density, but with the addition of source and sink terms
that control their production and loss:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:temperature_equation">

$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) T = \dot{S}_T
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math" id="eq:specific_humidity_equation">

$$
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) q = \dot{S}_q
$$

</div>

where $\dot{S}_T$ and $\dot{S}_q$ are the sources and sinks of temperature and
specific humidity, respectively.
They are governed by a plethora of thermodynamic processes such as radiation,
evaporation, condensation, etc.

Although we won't delve further into the details behind the sources and sinks
of temperature and specific humidity in the atmosphere, we can denote these
equations as completing the full system of prognostic equations for the
atmosphere: Eqs. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:momentum_navier_stokes_state"></a>,
<a class="eqref" data-key="eq:continuity_eulerian_state"></a>,
<a class="eqref" data-key="eq:equation_of_state_atmosphere"></a>,
<a class="eqref" data-key="eq:temperature_equation"></a>, and
<a class="eqref" data-key="eq:specific_humidity_equation"></a>.
These equations form the basis of many weather and climate prediction models.

### In the ocean

Ideal gas law (Eq. <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:ideal_gas_law"></a>) doesn't apply to liquids and the
equation of state for seawater is not easily derived.
Instead, we assume that the ocean is a single-component fluid, and we use the
density field $\rho$ as the equation of state.

<div class="display-math" id="eq:equation_of_state_ocean">

$$
\rho = \rho(T, S, p) \\
= \rho_0 \left[ 1 - \beta_T(T-T_0) + \beta_S(S-S_0) + \beta_p(p-p_0) \right]
$$

</div>

where $\rho_0$ is the reference density at the reference temperature $T_0$,
salinity $S_0$, and pressure $p_0$.
The coefficients $\beta_T$, $\beta_S$, and $\beta_p$ are the thermal expansion
coefficient, the saline contraction coefficient, and the pressure
coefficient, respectively.
This form of the equation of state is a linear equation of state (as in, the
dependence of density on temperature, salinity, and pressure each is linear).
Dependence of density on temperature and salinity at two different pressure
levels is shown in Fig. <a class="ref" data-key="fig:seawater_eqstate"></a>.
Higher order equations of state are often used for higher accuracy, however
they're out of scope for this course.

<figure class="book-figure" id="fig:seawater_eqstate">
  <img src="/figures/fig_seawater_eqstate.svg" alt="Contours of density as a function of temperature and salinity for seawater. Contour labels are (density - 1000) kg m. Le" />
  <figcaption>

Contours of density as a function of temperature and salinity for seawater. Contour labels are (density - 1000) kg m$^{-3}$. Left panel: at sea-level ($p = 10^5\ Pa$, or 1000 mb). Right panel: at $p = 4 \times 10^7\ Pa$ (about 4 km depth). In both cases the contours are slightly convex, so that if two parcels at the same density but different temperatures and salinities are mixed, the resulting parcel is of higher density. (The average temperature is not exactly conserved on mixing, but it very nearly is.) This is Fig. 1.3 in AOFD (Vallis, 2017).

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Like we did in the case of atmosphere, here we need to additional prognostic
equations, one of temperature and another for salinity:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:temperature_equation_ocean">

$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) T = \dot{S}_T
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math" id="eq:salinity_equation_ocean">

$$
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) S = \dot{S}_S
$$

</div>

where $\dot{S}_T$ and $\dot{S}_S$ are the sources and sinks of water temperature
and salinity, respectively.

Equations <a class="eqref" data-key="eq:momentum_navier_stokes_state"></a>,
<a class="eqref" data-key="eq:continuity_eulerian_state"></a>,
<a class="eqref" data-key="eq:equation_of_state_ocean"></a>,
<a class="eqref" data-key="eq:temperature_equation_ocean"></a>, and
<a class="eqref" data-key="eq:salinity_equation_ocean"></a> are the governing equations used in most
numerical ocean circulation models.

<span id="sec:nondimensionalization_and_scaling" class="sec-anchor"></span>

## Nondimensionalization and scaling

A useful technique to simplify the analysis of the governing equations is to
scale the variables using characteristic values for each of the variables.
This is known as <em>nondimensionalization</em>
or <em>scaling the equations</em>.
In practice, for each (dependent or independent) variable $x$ in the equations,
we define a characteristic value $X$.
For example, for the velocity $\mathbf{u}$, we may pick the characteristic
value of $U = 1$ m/s or $U = 10$ m/s for the ocean or atmosphere, respectively.
We then divide each term in the equations by the characteristic value to
obtain a nondimensional (unitless) number.
This helps us identify the important parameters that govern the behavior of
the system and to group terms in the equations that are of similar magnitudes.
This is especially useful for large-scale flows, where the length and time
scales can vary over several orders of magnitude.

Let's look, for example, at the vector equation for horizontal momentum
(thus, ignoring $\mathbf{g}$ for now):

<div class="display-math">

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} =
- \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}
$$

</div>

The characteristic scales for each term are:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:scaling_time_derivative">

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} \sim \frac{U}{T}
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math" id="eq:scaling_advection">

$$
(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} \sim \frac{U^2}{L}
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math">

$$
- \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p \sim \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{P}{L}
$$

</div>

<div class="display-math">

$$
\nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} \sim \nu \frac{U}{L^2}
$$

</div>

where $U$, $T$, $L$, and $P$ are the characteristic scales for the velocity,
time, length, and pressure, respectively.
So, if for a given flow we can estimate these characteristic values, we can
easily determine which terms are important and which can be neglected.
This is the basis of scaling arguments in fluid mechanics.

This approach also enables characterizing the flows in terms of
nondimensional numbers.
For example, to describe how turbulent or laminar a flow is, it's useful to
relate the inertial to the viscous terms in the momentum equation.
Their ratio is called the  <em>Reynolds number</em>:

<div class="display-math" id="eq:reynolds_number">

$$
\frac{(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u}}{\nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}} \sim
\frac{\frac{U^2}{L}}{\frac{\nu U}{L^2}} = \frac{UL}{\nu} \equiv \text{Re}
$$

</div>

You see that the Reynolds number is proportional to the velocity and length
scales each, and inversely proportional to the viscosity.
A larger Reynolds number corresponds to a more turbulent flow.

## Exercises

      the Eulerian form and vice versa. What is the key equation that relates the
      two forms?

2. Consider two opposing, horizontal, surface currents along the $x$-axis.
      In the vertical they uniformly span a mixed layer that extends from the

      The two currents meet at a stagnation zone that is 100 meters wide.
      Calculate the downwelling velocity at the bottom of the mixed layer.

      tensor in a Cartesian, 3-dimensional coordinate system.

5. Write a function in your favorite programming language that takes a
      value of temperature, salinity, and pressure and returns the density of
      seawater. Assume linear dependence of density on temperature, salinity, and
      pressure. Take the thermal expansion coefficient to be $\beta_T = 1.67 \times 10^{-4} K^{-1}$,
      the Haline contraction coefficient to be $\beta_S = 7.8 \times 10^{-4} g\ kg^{-1}$,
      and the compressibility coefficient to be $\beta_p = 4.4 \times 10^{-10} Pa^{-1}$.
      Take the reference density to be $\rho_0 = 1027\ kg\ m^{-3}$, the reference
      temperature to be $T_0 = 283\ K$, the reference salinity to be $S_0 = 35 g\ kg^{-1}$,
      and the reference pressure to be $p_0 = 10^5\ Pa$.
      When you implement your function, calculate the density of seawater for the
      range of temperatures from -2 to 30 degrees Celsius, and salinities from 20 to
      40 g/kg, and plot it as a contour plot as a function of temperature and salinity.
      Make such plots for pressure values of $10^5$, $10^6$, and $10^7$ Pa.

6. Calculate the Reynolds number for:
      (a) a synoptic-scale mid-latitude cyclone in the atmosphere;
      (b) an mesoscale ocean eddy;
      (c) a river inflow into the ocean;
      (d) a breaking ocean surface wave;
      (e) water flowing through a pipe with a diameter of 0.1 m and flow speed of 1 m s$^{-1}$.
      Assume $\nu = 10^{-5} m^2 s^{-1}$ for air and $\nu = 10^{-6} m^2 s^{-1}$ for water.
