* **Instructor**: Prof. Milan Curcic (mcurcic@miami.edu)
* **When**: Mondays & Wednesdays 9-10:15
* **Where**: MSC 329
* **Office hours**: By appointment

## Description

This course provides an overview of fundamentals of fluid mechanics at the
graduate level with emphasis on topics relevant to ocean physicists.
Topics covered include:
a review of relevant fundamentals including vector calculus and tensors;
fluid kinematics;
Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions of fluid flows;
the continuity (mass conservation) equation;
momentum balances and the equations of Euler and Navier-Stokes;
Bernoulli equations;
vorticity dynamics;
steady and nonsteady flows;
incompressible flows;
irrotational flows;
laminar flows;
turbulence;
boundary layers;
flow stability;
rotating and stratified flows;
waves (acoustic, surface-gravity and internal-gravity) in fluids.

## Prerequisites

* Calculus
* Classical mechanics

## Textbooks

Lecture notes will be available at
[https://github.com/wavesgroup/fluid-mechanics-notes](https://github.com/wavesgroup/fluid-mechanics-notes).

Further, these textbooks will be used as useful reference material but are not a
required course expense.

* _Fluid Mechanics, 6th ed_ by Kundu, Cohen & Dowling
* _Essentials of Atmospheric and Oceanic Dynamics_ by Geoffrey Vallis

## Learning outcomes

* Students will have an understanding of the fluid mechanics fundamentals
that are applicable to ocean physics research and that are used in the
peer-reviewed literature relating to ocean physics.
* Students will become proficient in applying fluid mechanical concepts and
related mathematical tools to ocean physics research problems.

## Grading

* Homework (40%); assignments will be given every Wednesday and due the following Monday.
* Final exam (60%); exam is open-book take-home exam, due in 48 hours.
