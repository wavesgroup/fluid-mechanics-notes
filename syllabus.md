# OCE 575/675 (Fluid Mechanics) Syllabus

* **Instructor**: Prof. Milan Curcic (mcurcic@miami.edu)
* **When**: Mondays & Wednesdays 9-10:15
* **Where**: MSC 329
* **Office hours**: By appointment

## Description

This course provides an overview of fundamentals of fluid mechanics at the
graduate level with emphasis on topics relevant to ocean physicists.
Topics covered include:

* **Fundamentals of classical fluid mechanics**: Vector calculus; fluid kinematics;
Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of fluid flows; conservation of mass and momentum;
* **Geophysical fluid mechanics**: Effects of rotation and stratification;
shallow water systems; steady state solutions.
* **Turbulence**: Reynolds decomposition; Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations;
Reynolds stress; turbulent kinetic energy budget; turbulent cascade; boundary layers;
channel flow; laminar vs. turbulent flows.
* **Surface gravity waves**: Small-amplitude wave theory; dispersion relation;
wave kinematics; wave-induced orbital velocities; Stokes drift.

## Prerequisites

* Vector calculus
* Classical mechanics

## Textbooks

Lecture notes are available at
[https://github.com/wavesgroup/fluid-mechanics-notes](https://github.com/wavesgroup/fluid-mechanics-notes).

Further, these textbooks will be used as useful reference material but are not a
required course expense.

* _Fluid Mechanics, 7th ed_ by Kundu, Cohen, Downling & Capecelatro
* _Essentials of Atmospheric and Oceanic Dynamics_ by Geoffrey Vallis

## Learning outcomes

* Students will have an understanding of the fluid mechanics fundamentals
that are applicable to ocean physics research and that are used in the
peer-reviewed literature relating to ocean physics.
* Students will become proficient in applying fluid mechanical concepts and
related mathematical tools to ocean physics research problems.

## Grading

* Homework (20%); assignments will be given every Wednesday and will be due the following Monday.
  Each assignment is graded on a scale of 0-3 (0: not submitted; 1: incomplete;
  2: complete and partially correct; 3: complete and correct).
  I use fractional scores where applicable, so, for example, a complete and mostly
  correct assignment may give you a 2.5.
* Midterm exam (30%); closed book, in person, one class period.
* Final exam (50%); closed book, in person, one class period.
